# Life-Expectancy
Here we create a Random Forest Classifier to predict life expectancy.
We have used life expectancy dataset from WHO for the analysis, it has health factors for 193 countries. Among all categories of health-related factors only those factors which are more representative are chosen. 
The importance of life expectancy comes from the fact that there is no better indicator of a countryâ€™s socio-economic development than having a long and healthy life.

Life expectancy at birth measures health status across all age groups. Shifts in life expectancy are often used to describe trends and mortality. Being able to predict how populations will age has enormous implications for the planning and provision of services and support. 

This is very useful for planning economic needs and costs largely on a societal basis and to a lesser extent an individual basis.

To get started with the project the user will first have to download life_expectancy_eda_and_prediction.ipynb, DA Report, and Life Expectancy Data.csv.
Then we would recomed the user to open and read our DA Report so that they can understand why each step was taken in the ipynb file and what do each step produce.
The user can then go on and load the ipynb and csv file on the same folder and then run the ipynb file (Recomended to do in collab notebook) which will produce all the outputs.
